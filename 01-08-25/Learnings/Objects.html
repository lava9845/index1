1. Properties of JavaScript Objects:
Accessing Properties:
  Properties of a JavaScript object can be accessed using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).
2. Length of JavaScript Objects:
   Determining Length: JavaScript objects do not have a built-in length property like strings or arrays. To get the "length" in terms of the number of properties, you can use Object.keys(obj).length.
3. Subset of Properties/Values from JavaScript Objects:
Creating a Subset: You can create a new object containing a subset of properties using:     

        const originalObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
        const { a, c } = originalObject; // Extracts 'a' and 'c'
        const subsetObject = { a, c }; // Creates a new object with 'a' and 'c'

4. Properties, Length, and Subset of JavaScript Strings:
Properties: String objects have various built-in methods (e.g., toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), indexOf()) and a length property.
Length: The length property directly returns the number of characters in a string. 

        const myString = "Hello";
    const stringLength = myString.length; // 5

Subset of String (Substring):
substring(startIndex, endIndex): Extracts characters from startIndex up to (but not including) endIndex.
slice(startIndex, endIndex): Similar to substring, but handles negative indices for counting from the end of the string.
substr(startIndex, length): Extracts length characters starting from startIndex. (Note: substr() is considered a legacy feature and slice() is generally preferred).
       

          const myString = "JavaScript";
    const sub = myString.substring(0, 4); // "Java"
