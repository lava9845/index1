 Promises in JS:
     To manage asynchronous actions in JavaScript, promises are used. It is an assurance that something will be done
The promise is used to keep track of whether the asynchronous event has been executed or not and determines what happens after the event has occurred.
A Promise has four states: 
fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
rejected: Action related to the promise failed
pending: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
settled: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
  

  Example:
      Let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
});
A promise can be created using Promise constructor.

Callback in JS:
      
     Callbacks are a great approach to dealing with something once another task has been finished.
      Here, "something" refers to the execution of a function.
      Callbacks can be utilized if we wish to run a function immediately following the return of another function.


      Example:
      
      function add(a, b, callback) {
    console.log(`The sum of ${a} 
    and ${b} is ${a + b}`);
    callback();
}
function disp() {
    console.log(`This must be printed
     after addition`);
}
add(5, 6, disp)
